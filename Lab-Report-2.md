The handleRequest method is being called in my code. 

The relevant arguments for the method would be the URL as everything after /add-message in the URL determines the outcome of the method. The relevant fields of the class would be the `String` inputs. 

The values of the field `String` inputs gets changed as a statement is added to the string, from an empty string to "Philip: The+weather+is+very+nice+today".

The handleRequest method is being called in my code. 

The relevant arguments for the method would be the URL as everything after /add-message in the URL determines the outcome of the method. The relevant fields of the class would be the `String` inputs. 

The values of the field `String` inputs get changed again as there is an additional statement being added to the `String`. There is an additional statement that is added to the `String` inputs, which will read

"Philip: The+weather+is+very+nice+today

Sean: Yes,+I+agree.+The+weather+is+quite+nice!".
