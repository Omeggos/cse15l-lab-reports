The handleRequest method is being called in my code. 

The relevant arguments for the method would be the URL as everything after /add-message in the URL determines the outcome of the method. The relevant fields of the class would be the `String` inputs. 

The values of the field `String` inputs gets changed as a statement is added to the string, from an empty string to "Philip: The+weather+is+very+nice+today".

The handleRequest method is being called in my code. 

The relevant arguments for the method would be the URL as everything after /add-message in the URL determines the outcome of the method. The relevant fields of the class would be the `String` inputs. 

The values of the field `String` inputs get changed again as there is an additional statement being added to the `String`. There is an additional statement that is added to the `String` inputs, which will read

"Philip: The+weather+is+very+nice+today"

"Sean: Yes,+I+agree.+The+weather+is+quite+nice!".

The absolute path to the private key for my SSH key would be C:\Users\Philip\.ssh\id_rsa.

* Part 3:

There was quite a bit of things that I didn't know coming into week 2 and three. Although I had some prior experience with GitHub, and the general git commands, I had no experience with creating servers.
Not only that being able to log onto a virtual server and being able to work in it through the terminal was an eye opening experience. I think that creating certain webpage servers was also quite interesting.
I never realized that we were able to create a web server through a compiler and importing a few classes into the file. I think that those two skills are the ones that I found to be the most intriguing from week two and three.
