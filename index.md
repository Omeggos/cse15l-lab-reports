   The working directory when the code was run, was in /home/lecture1/messages, and it ends in /home.
   
   When calling cd without any arguments, it will be brought back to the home directory.
   
   The output was not an error.

   The working directory when the code was run, was in /home, and it ended in /home/lecture1.
   
   When calling cd with a directory as an argument, the working directory will now be in the directory that was called as an argument.

   The output was not an error.

3. File as an argument

   The working directory when the code was run, was in /home/lecture1, and it ended in /home/lecture1.
   
   When calling cd with a file as an argument, it will not be able to cd into the file and instead stay in the same working directory as it cannot cd into a file, only directories.

   The output was an error because you cannot cd into a file.
